				<p>I was raised 60 miles north of New York City along the banks of the Hudson River in Newburgh, NY which is a small city of roughly 30,000 people.  Being a home to our first president George Washington, Newburgh was one of the first great industrialized small cities in the United States.</p>  
				<p>Unfortunately, as great as Newburgh was back then, I didn't get to experience the rewards of it's golden years because of decades of political corruption, gentrification, poverty, and structural degradation of most of it's great historic buildings.</p>
